            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>In manye places also the earth cleauing asunder, became a spÃ©edy and a voluntary Sepulcher for the inhabitantes. Moreouer, the fylthinesse of rayne water, with other fierye droughtes, and with some the fall of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning caused a diuerse and an vnsufferable calamitie. Furthermore, in many places Hayle was sÃ©ene to fall bigger than stones that one maye cast with his hande, weighing aboute eyghte pounde wayghte. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1179:90"/> the aboundaunce of Snowe, and extremitye of colde destroyed manye, whylste others liued in other quarters. All whiche thinges did sufficientlye preache before hande Gods heauye displeasure, all whiche to recounte one after another were too harde for a manne to doe. Besides all this there was so greate an Eclipse of the Sunne, that the Starres were sÃ©ene euen at noone daye, after whiche there followed such a drouth, that after a straunge sorte manye menne, and other liuing Creatures dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and when the Sunne fayled, a certayne shyning appeared also in the Elemente, bearing the forme of a Creste of an Helmet, or Sugerloafe, broade beneath, and sharpe towardes the toppe, whiche some igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunte menne called a Comet, and a bearded Starre, for nothing that was in it was like a Comet, neyther hadde it a beardye brightenesse, nor was it in any poynte like a starre, but sÃ©emed to be of it selfe as it were the flame of some great Candell, neyther didde anye of his beames beare the forme of anye Starre: his moouing also was diuerse, for that Lighte beganne to mooue on that syde where the Sunne aryseth by the Aequinoctium, and going awaye from thence by little and little, by the laste Starre whiche is placed in the Tayle of the Beare, healde his course to the Weast, and after he hadde raunged ouer the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more than foure Monthes, hÃ©e vanyshed awaye. Sometyme his toppe was so long and so sharpe, that it excÃ©eded the manner of a Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, but sometime it drew to the measure thereof: it also yielded other monstrous shewes, by the whiche it swarued from the nature of wonted and common appearances: He beganne first to appeare from mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sommer almost till the ende of Autumne.</p>
                  <p>This myracle also foreshewed greate Warres, and wonderfull death of men. And herevpon there beganne to be Earthquakes, whiche without doubt could not be compared with them that were before. With the Earthquake also fyre falling from heauen, as if it brake asunder, cut off menne from all hope of safetye, yet it didde them no harme, for Gods goodnesse by sending a strong wind, and by scattering the fyre on euery side cast it into the Sea: then a man might sÃ©e a new sighte, the surges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, euen as it were certayne regyons of the Sea, to burne excÃ©edinglye vntill that the flame was cleane quenched in the Water. When in manye places of the Earth there were such great Earthquakes, the cÃ©elinges and coueringes of the houses sÃ©emed to be pulled asunder one from another, with so great a noyse and crashing, that they which were within in their houses did plainly behold y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> element w<seg rend="sup">t</seg> their eyes, and after this maner of breaking they were agayne so fitly ioyned together, that they gaue no man anye sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of so straunge a thing: the same also happened in many places to Shippes and pauementes of houses. Certayne Garners didde choke them that dwelt vnderneath them, with the corne that aboundantly &amp; sodainly fel

Moreouer there were also other harmes of this kind, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a strange sort which did sufficiently declare that they did not procÃ©ed of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny naturall cause (as the doting followers of the <hi>Greeke</hi> superstition do say) but were sente vppon men as scourges of Gods heauye displeasure: manye men surelye saw at that time that those thinges happened through Gods wrath,<note place="margin">Iohn Baptist.</note> for so open a wrong that was offered to that moste worthye <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Light of the Churche, for a man might sÃ©e <hi>Eudoxia</hi> the Emperours wife (which then happened to die) to be made Wormes meate, and to moue the Coffin wherein she was put, God shewing hereby the commotion whiche by her was styrred vp in the church. <hi>Cassiodorus</hi> writeth also that y<seg rend="sup">e</seg>
